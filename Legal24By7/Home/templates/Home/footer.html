        <h7>24by7: Legal Information for Indian businesses</h7>
        <p>Since 2011, ​24by7 has been a one-stop solution for any business or entrepreneur looking for a lawyer, chartered accountant or company secretary. We have been particularly instrumental in ensuring startups are fully compliant with India's labyrinthine
            legal system. Over the past five years, the depth of our offerings, connection with reliable professionals, affordable prices and customer satisfaction has made us the largest online facilitator of legal services in India. We have already
            served over 120,000 customers and have a steadily growing network of over 1000 professionals from all the major cities (particularly the metros of Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata) on our online platform. In 2016, we launched
            <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">Libra</a>, a law practice management software, for legal professionals across India.</p>

        <h7>Starting a Business</h7>
        <p>Many founders are confused about what kind of entity to register when they start their business. Should it be a private limited company, <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">limited liability partnership</a>, partnership firm, one person
            company or a sole proprietorship. Each of these has very specific advantages and disadvantages. There is no one type for all businesses. A private limited company registration, for example, would be a good fit for any venture that will look
            for funding at a later stage. You can contact 24by7 for all the advice you need. We assure you of great service at a reasonable price. You can find a <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">company name availability here.</a></p>

        <h7>Intellectual Property</h7>
        <p>In modern business, there is no other asset as valuable as intellectual property, and yet so many startups end up neglecting it. But this is surely not advisable, as trademarks, copyrights and patents ensure that you have sole rights to your creation,
            be it your brand, your designs or your inventions. At 24by7, we are well equipped to handle all your IP requirements. We facilitate <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">trademark applications</a> in just three days, <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">copyright registration</a>            for all your software, pictures, audio and video content, and can connect you to patent attorneys to conduct a patent search and file your patent applications. You can find a <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">Trademark availability here.</a></p>

        <h7>Government Registrations</h7>
        <p>In India, you need a license for everything in business. Started a manufacturing business? You need a <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">GST Registration </a>and a <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">Trade License.</a> For
            a food business, you need an <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">FSSAI license.</a> Have employees? You need a Professional Tax registration and Shops & Establishments Act Registration. If that's not enough, you also need to file
            GST Returns and Professional Tax Returns.</p>

        <h7>Legal Documentation</h7>
        <p>The worst way to approach business is to just get into new partnerships and arenas without examining consequences. By getting a lawyer to draft contracts or agreements with new vendors, employees and investors, you're ensuring that you have all
            the downsides covered. At Vakilsearch, we connect you to lawyers who will deliver complex documents, from <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">shareholders' agreements </a>and founders' agreements to terms of service/privacy policy
            and non-disclosure agreements, at a reasonable cost in a few days' time. Well-known startups, such as Holachef and Big Basket, have chosen to connect with a lawyer through us for their documentation work.</p>

        <h7>Mandatory Compliance</h7>
        <p>It's not enough to have <a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;">started a private limited company</a> or an LLP. You need to comply with all the requirements of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Income Tax Act once you do. You need to
            inform them of every relevant change you make, whether it is adding a director, removing a partner or increasing authorised share capital. You also need to file annual returns and maintain your accounts. In the case of a private limited company,
            you even need them audited. At Vakilsearch, we facilitate all these services completely online. Which means you can engage a professional on retainer for the year and we'll ensure that all the formalities are completed for you while you focus
            on your business.</p>

        <h7>Libra for Lawyers</h7>
        <p>The legal fraternity in India comprises largely independent lawyers and small law firms with under five partners. Such practices have a difficult time managing their practices efficiently. Our<a href="#" style="color: #436aee!important;"> law practice management software </a>Libra
            is, therefore, a game-changer, as it will enable lawyers to single-handedly manage their practice. It gives them 24-hour access (on mobile and desktop) to their clients, cases, schedule, bill payments and even nation-wide judgements. <a href="#"
                style="color: #436aee!important;">Software for lawyer's offices</a> will have a huge impact on any area of the practice.</p>
